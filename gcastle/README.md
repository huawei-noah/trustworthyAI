## Introduction

gCastle is a causal structure learning toolchain developed by [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](https://www.noahlab.com.hk/#/home). The package contains various functionalities related to causal learning and evaluation, including: 
* Data generation and processing: data simulation, data reading operators, and data pre-processing operators（such as prior injection and variable selection).
* Causal structure learning: causal structure learning methods, including classic and recently developed methods, especially gradient-based ones that can handle large problems.
* Evaluation metrics: various commonly used metrics for causal structure learning, including F1, SHD, FDR, TPR, FDR, NNZ, etc.

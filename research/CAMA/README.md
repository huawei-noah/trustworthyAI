# CAMA: Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models with Causal Knowledge

**CAMA** is a two-stage causal framework that enhances LLMs’ mathematical reasoning by constructing and refining a Mathematical Causal Graph (MCG) of knowledge points and their dependencies, then using task-relevant subgraphs to guide reasoning and improve problem-solving performance.
